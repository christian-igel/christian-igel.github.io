<h4>Investigating the Influence of Depth and Degree of Genotypic Change on Fitness in Genetic Programming</h4>


<em>Erratum:</em> We thought of binary trees when the second paragraph on the second page
(i.e. 1062) was written...

<h4>Protein Fold Class Prediction Using Neural
Networks with Tailored Early-Stopping</h4>
 
<em>Erratum:</em> In section III, 2nd paragraph, it has to be: ``The network is
trained on <I>D</I><sub><small>train</small></sub> until the classification error on 
<i>D</i><sub><small>train</small></sub> vanishes (or falls below some predefined threshold).''

<h4>Evolutionary Tuning of Multiple SVM Parameters</h4>
 

<em>Erratum:</em> The standard deviations in the table are <em>too
large</em> by a factor of square root 19 (approx. 4.4). This is
corrected in the extended journal version of the paper.

<h4>Femoral Cartilage Segmentation in Knee MRI Scans Using Two Stage Voxel Classification</h4>


<em>Erratum: </em>In the equation of the stopping criterion (just below the first table), the signs of the gradient components must be inverted.
